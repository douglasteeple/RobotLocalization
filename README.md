# RobotLocalization
## Udacity Term 2 Robo-ND Localization Project

### Abstract
This project is the creation and testing of two robot simulations in a ROS (Robot Operating System) / Gazebo / RViz simulation environment. Both robots use Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization techniques combined with a navigation plugin to successfully navigate a maze to reach a predefined goal position. The two robot designs are compared for efficiency in reaching the goal.
